What do we do need to connect to a server
    Two types of  hosts: server & client
        What is a server: as long as I am sharing and giving reousrces or services to requestors, I am the server
        What is a client: as long as I am receiving or requesting for resources or services, I am a client
          You have the docker desktop on your comouter
          Inside the docker desktop, you have Containers, which are mini computers

          Who is the server: your computer
          Who is client: the containers
          Example:
          The computer is sharing memory & storage
          The containers are requesting memory and storage
  To connect to computer: username & passowrd
  To connect to github: username & passowrd
