# Google Cloud Plartform GCP
  What is GCP:
  cloud: simply virtualization in a remote location
  suite: stack or many applications or services offered as a package
  AI: Artificial intelligence
    GCP is a public cloud vendor that offers a suite of computing services to do everything from data management to delivering web and video over the web to AI and machine learning tools. Customers are able to access computer resources housed in Google's data centers around the world for free or on a pay-per-use basis

What do we do need to connect to a server
    Two types of  hosts: server & client
        What is a server: as long as I am sharing and giving reousrces or services to requestors, I am the server
        What is a client: as long as I am receiving or requesting for resources or services, I am a client
          You have the docker desktop on your comouter
          Inside the docker desktop, you have Containers, which are mini computers

          Who is the server: your computer
          Who is client: the containers
          Example:
          The computer is sharing memory & storage
          The containers are requesting memory and storage
  To connect to computer: username & passowrd
  To connect to github: username & passowrd
  To connect to Github via cli: ssh pubkey & private key

  Two main methods to connect: (username & password), ssh keys, tokens

  How do i create a server in GCP
   We will get to this:

  What does it take for one to know a file type:
    We can identify the file type via the extention
      example: file1.txt file1.yaml
      file1.pdf, file1.doc file1.exe

  How permissions are beign granted
    chmod: the command 
    option calue: r w x = 4 2 1 = 7
      example: 
        rw-r--r-- = 644
        rwxr-xr-x  = 755
        711 = rwx--x--x
        600 = rw-------
        744 = rwxr--r--
    user-group-other = xxx-xxx-xxx 
    example:
      chmod 755 file1
  
  How did it come about the default permnissions for both files & directories: its a story that the creators decided

  What is the default umask value: 
    # https://linuxize.com/post/umask-command-in-linux/#:~:text=the%20chown%20command.-,Understanding%20umask,user%2C%20group%2C%20and%20others.

    By default, on Linux systems, the default creation permissions are 666 for files, which gives read and write permission to user, group, and others, and to 777 for directories, which means read, write and execute permission to user, group, and others

  How to assign or change permission to a file
      example:
      chmod 755 file1

  How to become a root user
    you need to use sudo  command
    Example:
      sudo apt install nano
      sudo yum install nano
