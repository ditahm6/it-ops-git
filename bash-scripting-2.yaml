  # $ – requires given linux commands to be executed as a regular non-privileged user

Step 1: First you need to find out where is your Bash interpreter located. Enter the following into your command line

  # I am using a centos7 os --> operating system
  # to update centos, use the yum package manager
    yum update -y
  # To check the interpreter, execute the following command
  which bash
  expected output:
    # I did not have the which package isntalled. To isntall which
    # To know more about install which, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27815420/bash-centos7-which-command
    # yum update && yum install which -y
    # When I isntalled which, i got the following putput
    [root@centos-1 /]# which bash
    /usr/bin/bash
    [root@centos-1 /]# 

 Step 2
   The next thing you need to do is open our favorite text editor and create a file called hello_world.sh. We will use nano for this step
   nano hello_world.sh
   # I got a nano command not found, what do I do?
   # update and isntall the missing package
   yum update && yum install nano -y

      [root@centos-1 /]# cat hello_world.sh 
      #!/usr/bin/bash
      # declare STRING variable
      STRING="Hello World"
      # print variable on a screen
      echo $STRING

 Step 4  Navigate to the directory where your hello_world.sh script is located and make the file executable:
  chmod +x hello_world.sh 
  [root@centos-1 ~]# chmod +x hello_world.sh 
  [root@centos-1 ~]# ls

Step 5 Now you are ready to execute your first bash script:
    ./hello_world.sh 
    [root@centos-1 ~]# ./hello_world.sh 
    Hello World
    [root@centos-1 ~]#
