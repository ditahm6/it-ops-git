! What is a variable
  A variable is simple any information that is stored in another word and is used in bash

    Tasks: create a variable called name & store your full names inside
      name="Cookie Rosa"

    Why did I not use specify/call Cookie Rosa in the script or in the code/ why did i decide to use a variable
      * I can use it anywhere I want, i will just call the variable 
        What does it help you achie
          ==> cleaner code or script
          ==> make you efficient

! Most command type of variables

  global variables --> called be used anywhere inside a script
  local variables --> can be used anywhere inside a funtion
  system variables --> can be used anywhere inside the system

  SCRIPT: IT IS A SET OF LINUX COMMANDS IN A FILE

  a repository: is a storage location
  sudo: enables the current user to assume admin/root priviledges 
  apt: is the package managet for debian/ubuntu repositories
  update: update the package repository that I have in my local
  &&: a symbol that enables the system to run the first command first then; the next command after the sysbols second
  install: the action the package manager should take
  -y : auto approve everthing


  # bash install-vim.sh
  bash is the shell interpreter
  install.sh is a file or a script 

  What is the command to make the file executable by only the user: chmod 700 <name-of-file>

    chmod 700 variable.sh

    To run the script, you can do any of the following
        # ./variables.sh
        #sh variables.sh
        #bash variables.sh

  Task for A Mira: tell me the command to create a variable that creates two files called "today" and "tomorrow"

    touch today tomorrow
    study="touch today tomorrow"

# postional paramenters
The position relative to the cursor starting from zero 

  - represented by 
    ** $1 for positiona parameter one
    ** $2 for positiona parameter two  
    ** $3 for positiona parameter three
    ** $7 for positiona parameter seven

    ls

    t="ls"

    use a variable to perform an action, append it with the bash symbol == $
    $t


    The default variable is the global varianble

    but when a local varaible is created, it becomes the default for that session



      local variable:
        song="African Queen"
      global variable:
        export name="Tse F. Clinton"
        export song="Our Father"

      make varibale persist:
        to make a variable persist, we need to create or add a global variable into the .bashrc file
        Step1: edit the bashrc file
        sudo nano ~/.bashrc

        Step2: naviate to a new line, make a commend, then put global variables
            # Creating my own variables
            export name="Tse F. Clinton"
            export song="True Story"
            export artist="Timaya"
            export hometown="Fiango"

        Step3: save the file and exit
        ctrl + x
        type y and press enter
        Step 4: log out and login for it to reload as an amateur

        as a professional, you can reload the shell with this command

        source ~/.bashrc






    echo "The numbers you gave me are $4 $0 $1 $4 $7"

    The numbers you gave me are 78 ./variables.sh 47 78 69
    The numbers you gave me are 78 ./variables.sh 47 78 69

    The numbers you gave me are

### Script 1
install-vim.sh
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install vim -y

To run it
bash install-vim.sh


############# Script 2

variables.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  # The next line, creates a variable, that stores my full names

  #identity="Etas Uni

  echo "The numbers you gave me are $4 $0 $1 $4 $7"

  # Print the content of this echo command to standard  output
  # echo "I am from $identity, I am hate Linux commands"

  # Making the script sleep for 2 seconds with the sleep command  and
  # Giving it a value of 2 seconds
  # sleep 2

  # Print the content of this echo command to standard  output
  #echo "Why am I styudying linux commands in a summer afternoon"


TO RUN IT
chmod +x variables.sh

./variables.sh

#### Script 3
file2.sh
#!/bin/bash

# define a local variable, song
# song="African Queen"
age="30"

# use the global variable already defined
echo "My name is $name"
