## Tar or archive a file in linux

  ! The tar command is used to rip a collection of files and directories into a highly compressed archive file commonly called tarball or tar, gzip and bzip in Linux.

    tar -czf myhome_directory.tar.gz /root 
    = 
    command + option + name we want to give to tarbal + what we want to archive

    tar = command to interact or create a tarbal
    -czf = options to use with tar command
        c – Creates a new .tar archive file.
        v – Verbosely show the .tar file progress.
        f – File name type of the archive file.
        z - to create a compressed gzip archive file
    myhome_directory.tar.gz = name we want to give to tarbal
    /root = what we want to archive/tarbal or what we want to compress

## Untar tar Archive File in Linux
  ! tar -xvf myhome_directory.tar.gz -C ./untar 

    What does the command above achieve:  
      The above command uncompress/untar/unarchive the tarbal(myhome_directory.tar.gz) into the directory untar

    tar -xvf myhome_directory.tar.gz -C ./untar 
    =
    command + option + name of the tarball + where want the contents of the tarball to be stored/placed

    tar = command to interact with the tarball
    -xvf = options to use with the tar command
      x = enables us to extract
      c = creates the files from the tarball 
      f = to give the files names
    myhome_directory.tar.gz = the tarball
    Optional:
      -C used if we want to specify a new location other than current working directory
      ./untar = directory where want to store the contents of the tarbal


# Variables in Bash scripts
  What is a compiler:
    - it is a program that translate the a programming languages source code into machine code, byte code or another programming language
  What is a variable: an argument that we create or define that stores something like an interger, a string, boolean etc

        what is an interger: an interger is a number with no decimal value [0,1 ..., 9] or it is an odd or even number or it is a whole number 

        What is a string: 
            - it is a line of caracter or a single character 
            - that we always define in a single quote or double quote
            - e,g "today" 'age12' 'it' "i-hate-linux"

        What is a boolean: 
          - it is a variable that only has two values true or false
          - e.g again, it can have two possible values, true or false
          - it depends on the programming language, it could or could not be in quotes

        what is a float: 
            - a variable that is not a whole number or must be in a decimal format
            - it does not always have to be in quotes
            - e.g 1.00 9.50 11.60

        What is a double:
            - it is a variable that can store very big/large numbers
            - it can be a whole or decimal number
            e.g 1,000,000.00, 1.12 etc

      [root@centos-1 ~]# cat bash-variable.sh
      #!/usr/bin/bash

      # Create a global variables in bash script
      name="Bobylashly, Wrestler"

      [root@centos-1 ~]# ./bash-variable.sh
      Bobylashly, Wrestler

      # print the valute of the variable
      echo $name
        # What is the command to give the file bash-variable.sh execute permission
        chmod +x bash-variable.sh

        # How to create a variable that tells us your name
          NAME="Cypro, F"
        # How to create a variable that tells us your age

Variables have the following format:
KEY=value
KEY=56
KEY="Some other value"
KEY=value1:value2

* The names of the variables are case-sensitive. By convention, environment variables should have UPPER CASE names.
* When assigning multiple values to the variable they must be separated by the colon : character.
* There is no space around the equals = symbol.

Variables can be classified into two main categories, environment variables, and shell variables.

  Environment variables: are variables that are available system-wide and are inherited by all spawned child processes and shells.

  Shell variables: are variables that apply only to the current shell instance. Each shell such as zsh and bash, has its own set of internal shell variables.

There are several commands available that allow you to list and set environment variables in Linux:

env: – The command allows you to run another program in a custom environment without modifying the current one. When used without an argument it will print a list of the current environment variables.
printenv: – The command prints all or the specified environment variables.
set: – The command sets or unsets shell variables. When used without an argument it will print a list of all variables including environment and shell variables, and shell functions.
unset: – The command deletes shell and environment variables.
export: – The command sets environment variables.




Question:
  should we use anyname we want to give to the tarball
    What do you think: Yes we can give any name to the tarbal, but it needs to have the extention .tar.gz
